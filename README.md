## ðŸŽ®How to play?
The game mode is quite simple: the player controls a mobile spacecraft that moves horizontally on the bottom of the screen, and must take down one by one the aliens that slowly approach the Earth. The approaching stages of the aliens to the World follow a unique pattern, a wide and orderly zig-zag that leads them slowly but surely to reach the bottom of the screen, decreeing the invasion and the consequent end of the game. <br>

The player defends the Earth by facing hordes of aliens with his ship. In the upper area of the screen, some "Big spacecraft" scroll from time to time, that is, bonus ships that, if shot down, allow the player to increase his score much faster. The game ends when the aliens reach the bottom of the screen or when the player runs out of lives.<br>

The player's ship can be destroyed by enemy fire. The spacecraft is partially protected by some immobile defensive bunkers which are gradually destroyed by the aliens' bullets.
